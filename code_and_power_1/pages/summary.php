	  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
       <p>Overall, the sites that we analyzed were very inclusive. 
	   The biggest faults came from the technical aspects of how users can interact with the content. 
	   In the Common App website, the information remained consistent across devices, 
	   but to effectively use the site, one would need a desktop computer. 
	   On both the Madison Police Departmentâ€™s page and the Educational Toys website, 
	   broadband and connection speeds posed the biggest issues. Another big issue was the lack of translation options, 
	   which exclude large portions of the non-English speaking population. 
	   The website that we found to be the most tech friendly was Abby the Librarian. 
	   The barriers to use for the websites evaluated do not represent an intentional scheme to prevent certain groups from gaining access. 
	   Instead they show how the privileges of those creating the websites overlook key elements, 
	   like language, because the insularity of their experiences cause them to overlook the needs of other populations. </p>
