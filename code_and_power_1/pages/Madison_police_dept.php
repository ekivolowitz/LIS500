    <h1>Government Website: Madison Police Department (MPD)</h1>

      <h3>Platform Compatibility</h3>
      <p>This website is designed to be accessable from all devices: Mac/PC and IOS/Adroid.
        There is, however a huge problem with the site. On multiple attempts to visit the website
        the page was either incredibly slow to load, or not able to load at all. This was not consistantly
        the case, but happened often enough to be really frustrating. This would be an enormous problem for people 
        who don't have regular access to a computer, and can't just try again later, and an accessability issue
        for people who rely on the department's online form submission options for things like accident reporting.
        The MPD should immediately address this issue.

      <h3>Navigation and Usability</h3>
      <p>There are links to a lot of resources on this site. Much thought went into catagorizing 
        and making the content on the site, and MPD in general, as accessable as possible to the public. 
        There is so much information that finding what you are specifically looking for could be problematic, 
        especially for someone who is unfamiliar with searching. However, the most important contact info is featured prominantly
        on the homepage, making it easy for a user to call and get further, non-internet dependent help. MPD also has a presence
        on many social media platforms, although we didn't specifically look into how that presence is being managed. The glaring 
        oversite for most of the website is the lack of accessability for non-English speakers. In a city like Madison with prominant
        Hispanic and Hmong populations, it seems almost overtly discriminatory to not provide important, basic civic 
        information in the languages pertinent to the population. The Safe Communities of Dane County website, which is linked prominantly 
        with the MPD website, has a Spanish-language translation option overlaying the site. MPD should immediately implement a translation 
        option for their site.

      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
      <p>The MPD website is designed to be a civic resource for the general public in the city of Madison, and the site, except for the 
        above mentioned lack of language accessabiltiy does appear to be doing a decent job in providing access to public forms,
        general safety information, and other important public information. The MPD is using the site to post demographic information
        about police interaction with the public. This trasnparency is refreshing, and invites public to engage in public, proactive
        discussion about the racial and cultural implications of policing in the communtity.
