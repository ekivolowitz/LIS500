      <h3>Platform Compatibility</h3>
      <p>The website is well-designed and is usable accross all the 
        platforms we tested including Apple and Android phones,
        Macs and PC's. The biggest concern with user access to this website 
        could be the amount of bandwidth required to load the page. There are 
        many pictures, and some dynamic graphic elements that could be problematic
        for mobile devices or for users with limited wireless or broadband speed. 
      </p>
      <h3>Navigation and Usability</h3>
      <p>This site has a good navbar that allows users to find content using many different
        search criteria including age, gender, interest, etc. The search criteria work
        together so a user can refine their search by pricepoint and sale items. 
        When ordering, one of the required customer input fields is a telephone number. This 
        is not generally necessary personal information for an ecommerce website, and could
        be problematic and exclusionary for some populations. It also raises questions about 
        what this company is doing with user's personal identifiers.

      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
      <p>The site is not overtly exclusionary. The photos of children chosen as models 
        are a racially and ethnically diverse set. However, the business model is clearly 
        targeting people of middle/upper-middle class socioeconomic status. Within the 
        selection of products offered, the website does offer a catagory of product designed for
        and marketed to attract girls to science. There were very few offerings designed to
        introduce kids to coding. The products are generally expensive. The website is only offered
        in English, making it inaccessable to parents who are not English speakers.
