      <h1>The Common Application: Easing the College Application Process</h1>
      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>
        The Common Application, or Common App, was designed to streamline the process of applying to college. Accepted by
          over 750 universities in the United States and abroad,it provides a wealth of options for the high-schooler in their senior year
         looking at the prospects for university. The Common App essentially acts as a middle man by creating a single
          undergraduate application that can be submitted to a number of universities of the student's choice.

      <h3>Multiple Platform Compatibility</h3>
      <p>
          The Common App works across many platforms from android phones to PCs. However, the desktop version is the most
          practical. This is because there are a number of resources to review and download. To only use a mobile device
          would become extremely cumbersome. Even though desktop is ideal, mobile version is well adapted for viewing on
          smaller devices and information is laid out in a similar fashion as the desktop. In addition to online
          versions of the site, there is an actual app that can be downloaded on one's phone called Common App onTrack.
          It is important to note that the mobile app only acts as a complement to the desktop version. Students cannot
          complete the application through the mobile app. Instead they can manage tasks, see reminders and view their
          submission status.

      <h3>Ease of Access</h3>
      <p>
        Overall, the website for the Common Application is fairly accessible. The layout is clean and tabs are
          appropriately labeled. The site goes beyond just applying for college as well. There are resources for
          figuring out how to pay for college, exploring colleges, and why even go to college. It is the ultimate guide
          for the student thinking - "I'm graduating high school, and am considering college. Now what?".
          Features like the virtual counselors also add to theme of catering to the student about to embark on the next
          stage of their life. It is free and relatively straight forward to set up an account. The only major access
          issue comes when a student without reliable desktop access tries to apply online. The website does not see
          typing into the essay box as an activity and will erase any unsaved information when it times out every hour.

      <h3>Demographics</h3>
     <p>The Common Application is most obviously targeted at college-bound students with internet access. Evidence of
     this is primarily the content of the website which has everything to do with preparations for applying to college and advice
     on logistical matters. Also the fact that it is an online application assumes that the users have steady internet
     access. A less obvious target demographic however are users with desktop computers at home. A nice feature of the website is 
     it has language options for both English and Spanish. Thereby broadening its base.</p>
