      <h1>Getting Started</h1>
      <p>The most common way people get started with Blockchain is to get started with Cryptocurrencies (crypto). To get started with Cryptocurrencies
        the most user friendly way to get started in the United States with Cryptocurrencies is through an exchange, like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com" target="blank">Coinbase</a>.
        Coinbase will allow you to convert your USD into Cryptocurrencies, and they will store them for you. While having Coinbase store your
        crypto for you is convenient, it also means that if the company gets hacked, your magic internet money is gone. That's why I recommend
        creating your own wallet. There are several bitcoin wallets available, with full descriptions on what they do, pros and cons, and how
        to install them on your computer <a href="https://www.bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet" target="blank">here</a>. There are other Cryptocurrencies
        that you can get involved with too. For example, <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://ripple.com/">Ripple</a>, and thousands of others.
        To watch prices, I recommend going to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/coins/">CoinMarketCap</a>.
