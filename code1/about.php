      <h1>About</h1>
      <h3>Life before Blockchain</h3>
      <p>Before Blockchain, ledgers were owned by trusted third parties. For example, Visa / Mastercard / American Express / Discover are trusted 3rd parties in most transactions.
        If Alice wanted to pay Bob with a Visa credit card, Alice would swipeher card in Bob's payment terminal.
        Then the transaction would be sent to Visa, and Visa would validate (ensure Alice has 
        enough available credit to make the transaction) the transaction, transfer funds from Alice's credit account (with Visa) 
        to Bob's credit account. In short, Alice and Bob take Visa to be a trusted third party and middleman to a transaction.
      </p>
      <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
      <p>As opposed to the previous example with a credit card company, the ledger is 
        not privately held. Imagine you wanted to live in a trustless world, however. One where no single authority validated transactions,
        and one where the transfer of assets was purely peer to peer (P2P). This is the power that Blockchain provides.
        Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology, so everyone has a copy of every transaction and can validate them for themselves. 
      </p>
      <h3>Applications of Blockchain</h3>
      <p>By now you've probably heard of Bitcoin, which is the first application of Blockchain. The creator of Blockchain also created
        Bitcoin - more about that in the <a href="learn-more.html">Learn More</a> section. Blockchain can be used for more than just
        magic internet money. Blockchain is wildly popular within the Research and Development groups at insurance companies and other
        industries because it provides a secure way to provide the same information to multiple parties, and ensure the data's integrity.
